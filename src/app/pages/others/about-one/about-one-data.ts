These were big enough to hold a 3.4” penguin, 2 bags of “penguin food” and a little penguin workbook along with some snowflakes for penguin bedding. Had briefly thought about using a hole punch to make some “air holes” in keeping with the pet carrier theme but since these were of thicker quality figured it would be harder then it was worth. I would definitely buy this brand again to use for a craft activity or for handing out treats. ”",

My 11 year old could assemble them and fill with the items well. they looked so cute. We also used them for the hotel guest box. We added a body wash, bottled water, asprin, chocolates and custom soap in each one. ”",
